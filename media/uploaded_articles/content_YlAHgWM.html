<!-- Depth Limited Search -->
Depth Limited Search or DLS is a search algorithm which can be considered as the super-set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Depth First Search</a> or DFS. In Depth Limited Search we apply the same logic of DFS but unlike DFS, all the nodes which are more than at a certain distance away from the start node are ignored. This distance is called the depth limit. To understand the use case of depth limited search, suppose that we have to search for the element "5" in the following infinite tree.

Let us first try searching the element using DFS. Although it's the programmer's choice, let us start searching from the left sub-tree at each node for the sake of this article. The trace of the search should resemble the image shown below.
