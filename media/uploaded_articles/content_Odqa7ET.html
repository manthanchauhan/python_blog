<p>Prerequisites: Inheritance, function overriding If you have any experience of object-oriented programming you must be familiar with the concepts of inheritance(Single and Multiple) and function overriding. At a fairly abstract level, super() provides you the access to those methods of the super-class (parent class) which have been overridden in a sub-class (child class) that inherits from it. Consider the code example given below, here we have a class named Square and an another class named Cube which inherits the class Square.</p>
[sourcecode language="Python3" highlight=""] class Square: def __init__(self, side): self.side = side def area(self): return self.side * self.side class Cube(Square): def area(self): face_area = self.side * self.side return face_area * 6 def volume(self): face_area = self.side * self.side return face_area * self.side [/sourcecode]
Note: Since Cube does not have an .__init__() method, the .__init__() of Square will be used for initialization of Cube instances (basic property of inheritance). Considering this example, we know that each face of a cube is a square and hence, face_area of Cube represents area of a Square. Now, it makes sense to evaluate face_area using .area() method of the class Square rather than calculating it manually, not only this will save us from rewriting the code but also it will allow us to change the .area() logic from one place. But as we have overridden the .area() method in Cube, we cannot call .area() method of Square using self.area(). Now this is a situation where super() comes in rescue. super() returns a proxy object of the parent class and then you call the method of your choice on that proxy object, thus, we can call the .area() method of Square using super() as, super().area(). Here follows a modified definition of the class Cube.
[sourcecode language="Python3" highlight=""] class Cube(Square): def area(self): return super().area() * 6 def volume(self): return super().area() * self.side() [/sourcecode]
Do note that we could have called the .area() of Square method as Square.area() rather than super().area() but the latter maker is easier to swap out the super-class or rename it when required, making the code much easier to maintain.
Passing arguments in super()
In the previous section we discussed how to use super() without any parameters, but that only provides us access to the methods of that super-class which is the immediate parent of the sub-class. To access the methods of that super-class which is not an immediate parent of the sub-class, we use super() with two arguments. Lets us consider an example of three classes named Square, SquarePrism and Cube to understand how to use super() with arguments. Now, a cube is just a special type of square prism whose height is equal to the side of it's base, and hence a Cube resembles a SquarePrism much more than it resembles a Square. Therefore, in this example the class Cube will inherit the class SquarePrism, and the class SquarePrism will inherit the class Square. For class Square we'll use the same definition we used in the previous section. Given below is the definition of our newly defined class, SquarePrism.
[sourcecode language="Python3" highlight=""] class SquarePrism(Square): def __init__(self, side, height): self.side = side self.height = height def face_area(self): base_area = super().area() lateral_area = self.side * self.height return base_area, lateral_area def area(self): base_area = super().area() lateral_area = self.side * self.height return 2 * base_area + 4 * lateral_area [/sourcecode]
A SquarePrism instance has two attributes, the side of it's square base and the height of the square prism. The instance method face_area() returns a tuple of two numbers representing the base area of the square prism and the lateral area of the square prism. Since the base is a square, for base area of the square prism we call the method Square.area() as super().area(). The .area() method returns the total surface area of the square prism. Until now we have use super() without any parameters, now follows the definition of the new class Cube which will demonstrate the use of super() with parameters.
[sourcecode language="Python3" highlight=""] class Cube(SquarePrism): def __init__(self, side) super().__init__(side=side, height=side) def face_area(self): return super(SquarePrism, self).area() def area(self): return super().area() [/sourcecode]
Unlike the methods .__init__() and .area() the .face_area() method of Cube is somewhat different from its counter-part SquarePrism.face_area(). For a cube the lateral area is equal to the base area and hence it is not meaningful for the .face_area() method to return a tuple, therefore, the .face_area() of the class Cube will return the area of one of the cube faces. Now, since each face of the cube is a square, it is again meaningful to use the .area() method of the class Square. Now, since the class Square is not an immediate parent of the class Cube, we cannot access the .area() method of the class Square as super().area() as it will call the method SquarePrism.area() instead. Here we use super(SquarePrism, self).face_area() to call the .area() method of the class Square, in the first argument, SquarePrism signifies that super() searches for the .area() method in the immediate parent of the class SquarePrism, that is in the class Square. The use of self as the second parameter provides the context of the current Cube object to super() for the requested .area() method to act upon. Remember that, to use super() in two argument form, it is necessary that the object passed as the second argument is an instance of the type passed as first argument. Note: Since the class Cube is a child of the class SquarePrism, a Cube instance is also an instance of the class SquarePrism and the class Square. Try the following code snippet and observe the output for the clarification of the above point. [sourcecode language="Python3" highlight=""] class Square: def __init__(self): pass class SquarePrism(Square): def __init__(self): pass class Cube(SquarePrism): def __init__(self): pass square = Square() squareprism = SquarePrism() cube = Cube() print(isinstance(squareprism, Square)) print(isinstance(cube, Square)) [/sourcecode] It is worthwhile to note that the zero argument form of super() can only be used inside a class definition as it is auto-filled by the compiler with the appropriate paremeters, i.e. if you use super() inside a class say X, super() will be converted into super(X, self) by the compiler. While the zero argument form of super() is popular among developers the two argument form might not seem to be of much use for now. But in multiple inheritance, the two argument form plays a very important role.
